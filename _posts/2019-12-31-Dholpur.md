This time when I went to Bharatpur, I made a point to take a day trip to Chambal River Safari. This is known for Crocodiles, Aligators and Indian Skimmers. It is about 110 KM from Bharatpur. Day was very foggy and no sunlight till 1 pm. We decided to take a boat ride at 2 pm and try our luck. I was lucky to see Skimmers in great numbers and many other birds that you see around water. Crocodile and Aligators gave us miss and so do Sun all day.

The journey from Bharatpur to Dholpur was scenic but all fog.

We reached around 11:30 AM and the whole area was filled with dense fog. Fog was so dense that we could not see other bank of the river. So, there was no possiblity to take the ride.
