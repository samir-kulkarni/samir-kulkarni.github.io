Everytime I visit Bharatpur, it mesmerizes with the variety of birds that you can see. Long walks are best to find wide variety of birds that makes this sanctury its adobe. From ducks to eagles, from Saras to Owls and from Python to Jackals. Posting some pictures from my recent trip to Bharatpur. 

Deers are fearless here and even poses for photographs.

Sarus crane is amazing sight and highlight of visit to Keoladeo. Got a chance on pair of Sarus Crane pair. Yes, they always seen in pairs. This beautiful creature is the tallest flying bird in the world, standing at a height of up to 5’9″. They’re not hard to spot with their large gray bodies and bright red faces and have become an iconic species of open wetlands.
Much like other cranes, the Sarus Crane forms long-lasting pair bonds and are considered symbols of marital fidelity in India. It is believed that the cranes mate for life and pine the loss of their mates even to the point of starving to death.
