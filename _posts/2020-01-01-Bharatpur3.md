After a day in Bharatpur which was marred by no sunlight and lot of fog and second day with similar weather at Chambal, the morning of third day gave little hope as it was less foggy at 6:30 am. Getting ready, we took auto to the park gate. Not many visitors were there so early. So, started the walk. 

Checking the lens and camera and clicked these beautiful flowers.
