There are many times we want to convert sketches to HTML. Microsoft Sketch UI does just that. It allows to quickly convert sketchs drawn on paper to HTML. Now, this may not go in actual production code but a good way to quickly create high fidality prototypes. Also, a good point to start laying your actual code.
