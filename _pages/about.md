My name is Samir Kulkarni. I am not a pro but avid photo shooter. Capturing the moments and cherishing them makes my busy life soother. It provides me opportunity to look back and enjoy watching those still moments and memories around them. Same applies to tech world. All the good things in the past are foundation to my approach to embracing new technologies.
